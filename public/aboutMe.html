<h1>About Me !</h1>
<hr size = "4">
<h3>Myself Swayam Prasad Sahoo.</h3>
<h4>I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at <a href = "https://cgu-odisha.ac.in/">CV Raman Global University</a>, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.</h4>

<p>I have a brief knowledge on java, python and c++ programming. I'm currently working on my Web and App Development skills to impliment my ideas and build projects.</p>

<p>Besides my academic interests, I'm a big fan of sport football. Also I like to do paintings and graphic designing in my leisure time.
  I always want to get involved in something may be beneficial or not, rather than sitting like a clown although Clowns have a very beautiful humor to make us laugh. </p>
